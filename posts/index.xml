Traceback is an easy Linux box that appears to have already been compromised. After scanning the site, I found a webshell that I used to gain access as a low-privileged user. This user has sudo access to a program that executes .lua scripts, so I wrote a simple .lua script to gain access as another user. As this user, I discover that the motd file, which displays a message when a user logs in, is writable.</description></item></channel></rss>
